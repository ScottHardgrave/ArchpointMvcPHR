    ArchPoint Personal Health Record software was developed to allow people to take an active role in their personal and familie's
    health care. The software allows users to create, consolidate, and maintain an accurate and up-to-date personal health record under their personal control.
    Since it is under the user's exclusive control, it cannot be viewed by emploers, insurance providers, or any government agency. All information is stroed in one secured place.
    <br /><br />
    ArchPoint PHR provides users with an excellent, easy to use program that enables users to share their personal and family's health information with healthcare providers and family members.
